        <p>Draft of Frankenstein, 1816. | Bodleian MS. 
          Abinger c.56 (formerly designated Dep. 477/1) consists of 62 leaves originally 
          bound in Notebook A, one of two now disbound notebooks in which Mary W. Shelley 
          (MWS) drafted the two-volume version of Frankenstein. The draft in c.56 runs 
          from the beginning to the end of Volume I, concluding just as the Creature is 
          about to begin his tale to Victor. </p>
